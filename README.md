I am a graduate with a degree in international politics. My academic journey has ignited a passion for data analysis. By mastering tools like SPSS and excel to extract insights from complex datasets. This experience has solidified my conviction that a career in data analysis is my calling. I have taken an intensive 12-week data skills bootcamp with Just It. This has expanded my toolkit to include Power bi, Tableau, SQL and advanced excel. Beyond technical proficiency my background in customer service has honed my communication and interpersonal skills, enabling me to collaborate in team environments and convey insights clearly to stakeholders.
